### Dependencies

    github.com/go-gl/gl/v2.1/gl
    github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.1/glfw
    github.com/gordonklaus/portaudio

The portaudio-go dependency requires PortAudio on your system:

> To build portaudio-go, you must first have the PortAudio development headers
> and libraries installed. Some systems provide a package for this; e.g., on
> Ubuntu you would want to run apt-get install portaudio19-dev. On other systems
> you might have to install from source.

On Mac, you can use homebrew:

    brew install portaudio

### Installation [Outdated]

The `go get` command will automatically fetch the dependencies listed above,
compile the binary and place it in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

    go get github.com/fogleman/nes

 >since Go 1.8, you don't need to set your GOPATH or GOROOT.
 >GOPATH by default is under your user/home directory.

### Quick Start
    git clone https://github.com/fogleman/nes.git
    cd nes/
    go mod tidy
    go build -o nesexe
    ./nesexe [rom_file|rom_directory]
 
### Error case
>golang version at least 1.18

>go mod tidy provides all ![Dependencies](https://github.com/ukaase/nes/preview/master/README.md#dependencies) required to wrappers of gl and glfw.
>but to use theses wrappers you will need the libraries of gl and glfw that you can install in your OS system following theses commands


[X11 and Glfw]

    sudo apt install libxcursor-dev
    sudo apt install libxinerama-dev
    sudo apt install libxi-dev
    sudo apt install libx11-dev
    sudo apt install libglu1-mesa-dev
    sudo apt install libxrandr-dev
    
    
[Glut]

    sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev


### Usage

    ./nesexe [rom_file|rom_directory]

1. If no arguments are specified, the program will look for rom files in
the current working directory.

2. If a directory is specified, the program will look for rom files in that
directory.

3. If a file is specified, the program will run that rom.

For 1 & 2, the program will display a menu screen to select which rom to play.
The thumbnails are downloaded from an online database keyed by the md5 sum of
the rom file.

### Controls

Joysticks are supported, although the button mapping is currently hard-coded.
Keyboard controls are indicated below.

| Nintendo              | Emulator    |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| Up, Down, Left, Right | Arrow Keys  |
| Start                 | Enter       |
| Select                | Right Shift |
| A                     | Z           |
| B                     | X           |

### Mappers

The following mappers have been implemented:

* NROM (0)
* MMC1 (1)
* UNROM (2)
* CNROM (3)
* MMC3 (4)
* AOROM (7)

These mappers cover about 85% of all NES games. I hope to implement more
mappers soon. To see what games should work, consult this list:

### Known Issues

* there are some minor issues with PPU timing, but most games work OK anyway
* the APU emulation isn't quite perfect, but not far off
