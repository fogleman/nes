### Dependencies

    github.com/go-gl/gl/v2.1/gl
    github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.2/glfw
    github.com/gordonklaus/portaudio

The portaudio-go dependency requires PortAudio on your system:

> To build portaudio-go, you must first have the PortAudio development headers
> and libraries installed. Some systems provide a package for this; e.g., on
> Ubuntu you would want to run apt-get install portaudio19-dev. On other systems
> you might have to install from source.

On Mac, you can use homebrew:

    brew install portaudio

### Installation

The `go get` command will automatically fetch the dependencies listed above,
compile the binary and place it in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

    go get github.com/fogleman/nes

### Usage

    nes [rom_file|rom_directory]

1. If no arguments are specified, the program will look for rom files in
the current working directory.

2. If a directory is specified, the program will look for rom files in that
directory.

3. If a file is specified, the program will run that rom.

For 1 & 2, the program will display a menu screen to select which rom to play.
The thumbnails are downloaded from an online database keyed by the md5 sum of
the rom file.

### Mappers

The following mappers have been implemented:

* NROM (0)
* MMC1 (1)
* UNROM (2)
* CNROM (3)
* MMC3 (4)
* AOROM (7)

These mappers cover about 85% of all NES games. I hope to implement more
mappers soon. To see what games should work, consult this list:

### Known Issues

* there are some minor issues with PPU timing, but most games work OK anyway
* the APU emulation isn't quite perfect, but not far off
